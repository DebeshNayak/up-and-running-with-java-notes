% Modulus division, also called remainder division

* Algebra to Java:
-----------------
* Area of a circle:
A = pi r ^ 2            -----> area = Math.PI * radius * radius

* Pythagoras Theorem:
a^2 + b^2 = c^2         -----> c = Math.sqrt(a*a + b*b)

* Equation of a line:
y = mx + b              -----> y = m * x + b or y = slope * x + yIntercept

* Boolean Expressions:
  - Evaluate to either true or false
    - They are used in decision statements
