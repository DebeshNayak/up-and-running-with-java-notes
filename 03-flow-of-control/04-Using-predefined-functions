- The Java API or application programming interface is a collection of software
  packages that programmers can use for graphics, user interface, networking, sound,
  database, math, and much more.

- It contains many methods that have already been written and tested. In order to
  use these specific methods in our program we have to import the necessary libraries
  by adding them to our program.
