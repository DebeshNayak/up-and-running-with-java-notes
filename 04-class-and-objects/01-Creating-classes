Creating Classes:

- A class is a blue print of an object.
Classes contains:
  * Instance data:
  * Constructor(s): which are special methods used to build an instance of our class.
                    - Easy to identify, there is no return type and exact name as class
  * Method(s): the blocks of code common to all objects of this class,
              - Represents the object's behavior.

Why classes?
* Reusable
  - Multiple programs can use the same class.

* Encapsulate data
  - Data is defined as private
  - Data is accessed using get and set methods
  (otherwise known as accessor and mutator methods)
