What is Algorithm?
- An algorithm is a set of steps needed to solve a problem.
- It is written in our native tongue, and not in any particular programming language.
- It helps the programmer to think through the problem and describe a possible solution without worrying about the implementation.

Example: Cookie Recipe

* Measure ingredients
* Preheat oven
* Mix ingredients
* Place on cookie sheet
* Bake for 10 - 20 minutes

Example - 2: Calculate Gas Price for a Trip

* What is the distance of the trip?
* What is the MPG of your vehicle?
* What is the price of one gallon of gas?

So,

* Calculate gallons needed (miles/MPG)
* Calculate total trip cost (gallons needed  * price)
