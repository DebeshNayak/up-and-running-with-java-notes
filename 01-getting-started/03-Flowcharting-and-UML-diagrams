Flowcharting and UML diagrams:

- Flowcharts are a great way to create a visual representation of our program flow.

- UML Diagram, Unified Modeling Language, also provide a visual of any classes we need to create.

- When creating flowcharts, it forces us to break our programs down into pieces, otherwise known as stepwise refinement.
- This shows us the processes needed to create our final solution.
- From these flowcharts, we can start to encapsulate portions of our code into smaller methods.

Flowchart Symbols:

* Start/End - round circle
* Process - rectangle
* Decision - diamond
* Data - Parallelogram
* Files - Report
