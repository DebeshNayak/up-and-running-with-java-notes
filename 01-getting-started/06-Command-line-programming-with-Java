- Create a Java Source code file

- We need to set the system environment path variable to set and run our program
from command line using the following command in the command line:

set path = %path%;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_112\bin
(This didn't work in windows 10)
or
-> got to "System Properties"
-> Environment Variables
-> Edit Path
-> Add the following new path
-> C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_112\bin

- To compile the java source code to byte code
javac <file_name>.java
- To run the java byte code
java <file_name>
