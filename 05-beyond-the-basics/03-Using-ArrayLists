Using ArrayLists:

Array can only hold primitive data types. So to store objects in the same way we need ArrayList.

Advantage:
* Increase and decrease the array size dynamically.

Disadvantage:
* Take up a bit more overhead.

** Array is a good choice if the size of the array and only dealing with primitive data.
* If we are using mixed data type then we have to use an ArrayList.
