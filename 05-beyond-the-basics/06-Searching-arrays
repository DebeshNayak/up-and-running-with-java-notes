Searching Arrays:
1. Binary Search:
  * Works only if the array is already sorted.
  * compares a search value to the middle value in array
  * If greater than that value, continues to split that half
  * If smaller, splits the smaller values in half, and repeats
  * Stops when value is found or array has been searched

2. Linear Search:
  * It starts with first element and compares it to the key.
  * It continues to search every element in the array.
  * If a match is found, it returns the position of the match.
  * If not found, it returns -1.
