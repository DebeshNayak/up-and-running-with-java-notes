- For file operation

To open and read a file we need to do the following steps:
1. Create a file object that specifies the filename, including the extension.
2. Use scanner class to declare an object that allow to read from the file.

To write to a file:
1. File output = new File("customers.txt");
2. PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(output);
3. out.println(name);
4. out.close(); // if missed still be in buffer and the file will be empty
