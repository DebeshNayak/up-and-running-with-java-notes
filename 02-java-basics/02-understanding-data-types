Understanding Data Types:
- Java is a strict data typing language.

Primitive Data Types:
* Characters:
  char letterA = 'a';

* Boolean
  Logic values that are either true or false
  boolean result = true;

* Integers (no fractional part)
  byte, short, int, and long

  byte(8 bit) -> -128 to 127
  short(16 bit) -> -32,768 to 32,767
  int(32 bit) -> -2^31 to 2^31-1
  long(64 bit) -> -2^63 - 2^63

* Rational Numbers (may have a fractional part)
  float, double

-> These data types are called primitive data types and other data types are called structured data
-> Primitive data types store their values directly in memory with the variable names
-> Structured data is stored by reference or by the address of the location and memory where the data exist

Choose a Data Type:
  Data                                Data type
* Number of cars in a parking lot     int
* Price of a grocery item             double or float
* The vowel "a"                       char
* The value "true"                    boolean
* Students in a classroom             int
