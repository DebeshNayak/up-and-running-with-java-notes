Debugging logic and syntax errors:
1. Syntax errors: A syntax error occurs when we make a mistake in our coding, such
  as forgetting a semicolon to indicate the end of a statement.

2. Logic errors: A logic error is harder to find. This occurs when we have all the
  correct syntax but we coded a portion of the program with an error, such as maybe, divide by zero.
