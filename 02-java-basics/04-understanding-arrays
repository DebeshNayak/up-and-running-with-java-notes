Understanding Arrays:

Grocery List:

* What if you have 100 items?
* You could create 100 string variables.
* You could create 100 double variables.

A better way:
* An array uses one variable name for multiple values.
* An array must be declared with a size or initializer list.
* And array is accessed using an index value.

Syntax:
data_type[] variable_name = new data_type[size];

Caution:
* Arrays can have an "out of bounds" error.
* Arrays are always a fixed size. (If we access data at a index value greater than the
  size of the array, then the program will abruptly end during execution, because this
  isn't checked ahead of time by the compiler.)
