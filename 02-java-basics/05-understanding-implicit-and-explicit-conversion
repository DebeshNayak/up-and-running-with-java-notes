Understanding implicit and explicit conversion:

* Change the data type of a variable

Data Types:
* Java is a strictly data-typed language.
* Each variable must have a specific data type.
* Data types can be change using implicit or explicit conversion.

Implicit Conversion:
* Occurs when an equation has multiple data types.
  - If you multiply 10 * 15.75, you get 157.50.
  - the average of 3, 5, and 8 is (3 + 5 + 8) / 3 is 5.33.
  - in Java we must rewrite the equation as (3 + 5 + 8) / 3.0

Explicit Conversion:
* Occurs when we use casting to change the data type
  - Using casting: (double)(3+5+8) / 3
